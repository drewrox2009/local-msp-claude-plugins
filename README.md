# MSP Claude Plugins

> One command to supercharge Claude Code for MSP workflows.

This fork is local-first: plugin manifests launch standalone MCP servers on your machine by default instead of routing through Wyre's hosted gateway.

```
/plugin marketplace add drewrox2009/local-msp-claude-plugins
```

Then restart Claude Code. That's it.

## Connection Model

### Local MCP Servers (Default)

This fork starts vendor integrations locally through each plugin's `.mcp.json`. In practice that means Claude Code launches the corresponding standalone MCP server with `npx` and your local environment variables.

### Official Remote Exceptions

Some plugins still intentionally use vendor-hosted or third-party remote MCP servers, including Pax8, HubSpot, PandaDoc, QuickBooks Online, Microsoft 365, SentinelOne, Rootly, and Xero.

---

## How it works

Plugins are just markdown files. They provide:

- **Skills** — Domain knowledge Claude references when helping you (API patterns, field mappings, rate limits)
- **Commands** — Slash commands like `/create-ticket` and `/search-tickets`

When you ask "create a high priority ticket for Acme Corp", Claude knows:
- Which API endpoint to call
- What priority values mean (varies by vendor!)
- How to authenticate
- Rate limit boundaries

---

## Architecture

Each plugin consists of three layers:

1. **Skills** — Markdown files with domain knowledge (API patterns, field mappings,
   vendor terminology). Low maintenance, easy to contribute to.
2. **Commands** — Slash commands for common MSP workflows. Moderate complexity.
3. **MCP Servers** — Full server implementations that connect Claude to vendor APIs.
   These handle authentication, rate limiting, and data transformation.

Most contributions touch skills and commands. In this fork, plugin manifest changes should prefer local MCP server launches over Wyre-hosted gateway URLs unless a plugin explicitly relies on an official remote MCP server.

## Individual plugins

Want just one vendor? Install individually:

```
/plugin marketplace add drewrox2009/local-msp-claude-plugins --plugin autotask
/plugin marketplace add drewrox2009/local-msp-claude-plugins --plugin syncro
/plugin marketplace add drewrox2009/local-msp-claude-plugins --plugin halopsa
/plugin marketplace add drewrox2009/local-msp-claude-plugins --plugin liongard
